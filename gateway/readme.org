* SoS Gateway

Gateway is a simple reverse proxy setup, which redirects traffic to SoS
components. This is meant to be used as the entry-point into the SoS cloud for:

- Development setup
- Single node deployments i.e deployments which don't need to horizontally
  scale; which want to conveniently just point all traffic to a single port and
  expect everything else to just work

When horizontal scaling comes into picture, we need to switch to something more
sophisticated.
